# DataVisualization_challenge
## Background 
In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.
Python Mathplotlib has been used to visualize the real data from the pharmacudical company to visualize and summary report from different regimen that has been used in this data  model. 
Data has been provided in the form of two separate CSV files called mouse_metadata.csv and study_results.csv, which these two has been merged into a single data frame to prepare the data, generate summary and create visualize charts and graphs. 


### Observation
- Bar graphs shows that the the maximum number mice are included in Capomulin regimen.
- After Removing duplicates mice total is 248 which include 51% male and 49% female.
- Tumor volum has decreased under Capomulin and Ramicane regimens
- The correlation between mouse weight and the average tumor volume is 0.84, which is the strong correlation that when weight increase the average volum of the tumor increases, as well.
- R_square value is a high number which indicates the data model is fit and the prediction of the data is fairly good.

### Tasks
1. Prepare the data.
2. Generate summary statistics.
3. Create bar charts and pie charts.
4. Calculate quartiles, find outliers, and create a box plot.
5. Create a line plot and a scatter plot.
6. Calculate correlation and regression.
7. Submit your final analysis.
